A relatively basic iOS app to control various Bluetooth-connected vaporizers. Built with modern Swift and UIKit.

## Device Support
The following devices are supported:

- Pax Labs
    - Pax 3
    - Pax Era (non-Pro, micro USB model)

## Disclaimers
Pax 3, Pax Era and Pax Era Pro are trademarks of Pax Labs.

The code to communicate with Pax devices was built based on information from [reverse engineering](https://blraaz.me/reverse-engineering/2021/08/29/bluetooth-reverse-engineering.html) the device's Bluetooth protocol and official first-party apps. There may be incompatibilities with past, current, or future firmware versions that can result in damage to the device. Thus, the app is provided with no warranty or guarantee that it will function properly. (tl;dr, don't sue me if your vape sets your house on fire)
